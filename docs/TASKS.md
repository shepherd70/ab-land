# ab-land — Task Tracker

> Living checklist of what's shipped, in flight, and queued for **ab-land**.
> Keep it current: when a PR merges, move its items to **Shipped**; when you start
> something, mark it **In progress**. This tracks *work* — see `CLAUDE.md` for the

## ✅ Shipped (merged to `main`)

- ✅ **#1 — Scaffold** — ingest pipeline, SQLite store, search-first UI, MapLibre wiring.
- ✅ **#2 — Offline ingest tests** — end-to-end PNG ingest coverage against fixture JSON (no network).
- ✅ **#3 — Company matching** — alias / predecessor grouping for company-profile search (`company_aliases.ts`).
- ✅ **#4 — ATS spatial search** — legal-land-description lookup with an offline coarse grid filter (`ats_grid.ts`).
- ✅ **#5 — Map** — attributed (OGL-Alberta) basemap, controls, fit-to-data (`basemap.ts`, `MapView.tsx`).
- ✅ **#6 — All mineral families** — 8 families field-verified & enabled in `config/sources.ts` (PNG/31, oil_sands/24, coal/39, minerals/57, brine/63, geothermal/72, carbon_seq/52+51, pore_space/75); searchable `target_substance` in FTS.
- ✅ **#7 — Map explorer (`/map`)** — province-wide interactive map: clustered centroid overview, R\*Tree-backed viewport polygon fetch on zoom-in, family color/legend/filters, click-through popup → holding (`MapExplorer.tsx`, `lib/map/families.ts`, `/api/map/{centroids,features}`, `dispositions_rtree`). First route-handler tests land here (`api_map.test.ts`, `map_viewport.test.ts`). Follow-up fix: `/map` fills the viewport height (PR #9).
- ✅ **#8 — Live-data correctness** — `lib/tenure.ts`: field-verified `AgreementType` code→label map (PNG lease/licence × Plains/Northern/Foothills bound by joining public offering notices ↔ GeoView issuances via the `TTYYMM####` number structure; other codes from type-specific leaf layers; legacy 001/002/003 from `ZoneDesc` substances; `A##` = application; `010` deliberately unmapped → "Type 010"). `9999-12-31` expiry renders "Continued / no expiry" in table, detail, and popup. Holding page is multi-tract aware (per-tract table, per-family sections for number collisions); company profile counts agreements vs parcels (`summarizeHoldings`). Coal `CoalCategory` labeled as policy restriction, substance row hidden when absent (brine).

## 🔨 In progress

- _(nothing active — `main` is clean and CI is green)_

## ⬜ Next up — map follow-ups

- ⬜ **Company-profile map.** The company page still has no map; reuse `MapExplorer` (or a seeded
  variant) to plot a single company's holdings. Natural extension of `/map`.
- ⬜ **Simplified geometry column.** Giant parcels (max ~3.5 MB) are re-sent whole per viewport move;
  add an ingest-time simplified-geometry column if panning lags.
- ⬜ **Application rows in tenure layers.** Geothermal/72 contains `A60` and PNG/31 two `A59` rows
  (applications, not granted tenure). They're ingested and labeled "– application"; decide whether
  to exclude or badge them in search/map views.

## 💤 Dormant — blocked on external input

- 💤 **Surface dispositions (Tier B / Altalis DIDs+).** Import-seam only (`scripts/ingest_surface.ts`); stays dormant until the user lawfully places files in `data/altalis/`. No public API.

## 🚫 Out of scope (do not build)

- 🚫 **Title / ownership (SPIN2 / ARLO, LINC, owner contact).** Gated, pay-per-search, scraping violates ToS. If a feature seems to need it — stop and flag.

## 🧱 Infra & quality

- ✅ **CI** — GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): `npm ci → lint → typecheck → test → build` on every PR and push to `main` (Node 24).
- ✅ **Test suites (8)** — ATS parsing (`ats`), company matching (`company_names`, `company_aliases`), spatial helpers (`geo`, `ats_grid`, `ats_search`), basemap config (`basemap`), offline minerals ingest (`ingest_minerals`).
- 🔨 **Route-handler tests** — the map handlers (`/api/map/{features,centroids}`) now have tests against a temp SQLite fixture (`api_map.test.ts`); the original 3 (`search`, `holdings/[id]`, `companies/[name]`) are still untested.
- ⬜ **Dependency hygiene** — 2 moderate postcss advisories inside Next's build toolchain are accepted (build-time only, single-user local app). Never `npm audit fix --force` (see memory `ab-land-npm-audit-fix-force`); revisit when Next bumps its bundled postcss.
